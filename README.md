# OOP-basics

Today we covered the OOP and the use of classes and Objects. 

We discussed how we use the OOP way to benefit from existing code as well as modularizing our code as opposed to procedural programming. 

The examples in class covered the declaration and definition of a Human Class and then using that class to instantiate objects within our code. 

We discussed the use of properties and methods and passing arguments to our methods. The basics of a method can be described as following:

-(return type) method name : (argument type) argument name ………

Not every method needs arguments and also many methods simple return void which is nil. 


We then discussed the use of arrays and mutable arrays. 

In general arrays help us with clustering objects of the same type into a single ORDERED object. 

Objects in array are called items, objects or elements. 
Number assigned to items is called Index.
Mutable arrays allow us to change, edit, add and remove from them. 
We can declare allows generically and let the initializer find out their type. 

We could also explicitly define the type of the objects in the array.


We also discussed the use of come control flow statements including

If statement conditionals
for loops


and we had a quick chat about some terminology:


IDE (integrated development environment) includes:
	Programming (Coding) - Obj-C
	Debugging
	Simulator


Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as opposed to Procedural
